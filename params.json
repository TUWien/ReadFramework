{"name":"Readframework","tagline":"The Core Framework for CVL/READ Modules","body":"# READ Framework\r\nREAD Framework is the basis for modules developed at CVL/TU Wien for the EU project READ. The READ project  has  received  funding  from  the European  Unionâ€™s  Horizon  2020 research  and innovation programme under grant agreement No 674943.\r\n \r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TUWien/ReadFramework.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TUWien/ReadFramework)\r\n\r\nDocumentation can be found here: http://tuwien.github.io/ReadFramework/html/\r\n\r\n## Build on Windows\r\n### Compile dependencies\r\n- `Qt` SDK or the compiled sources (>= 5.4.0)\r\n- `OpenCV` (>= 3.0.0)\r\n\r\n### Compile ReadFramework\r\n1. Clone the repository from `git@github.com:TUWien/ReadFramework.git`\r\n2. Open CMake GUI\r\n3. set your ReadFramework folder to `where is the source code`\r\n4. choose a build folder\r\n5. Hit `Configure`\r\n6. Set `QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE` by locating the qmake.exe\r\n7. Set `OpenCV_DIR` to your OpenCV build folder\r\n8. Hit `Configure` then `Generate`\r\n9. Open the `ReadFramework.sln` which is in your new build directory\r\n10. Right-click the ReadFramework project and choose `Set as StartUp Project`\r\n11. Compile the Solution\r\n12. enjoy\r\n\r\n### If anything did not work\r\n- check if you have setup opencv\r\n- check if your Qt is set correctly (otherwise set the path to `qt_install_dir/qtbase/bin/qmake.exe`)\r\n- check if your builds proceeded correctly\r\n\r\n## Build on Ubuntu\r\nnote that Qt 5.5 is needed, thus Ubuntu version must be >= 16.04 or backports of Qt 5.5 have to be used (see .travis.yml for an ppa repository and names packages which need to be installed)\r\n\r\nGet required packages:\r\n\r\n``` console\r\nsudo apt-get install qt5-qmake qt5tools-dev qttools5-dev-tools qt5-default libqt5svg5 qt5-image-formats-plugins libopencv-dev cmake git\r\n```\r\n\r\nGet the READ Framework sources from github:\r\n``` console\r\ngit clone https://github.com/TUWien/ReadFramework\r\n```\r\nThis will by default place the source into ./ReadFramework\r\n\r\nGo to the ReadFramework directory and run `cmake` to get the Makefiles:\r\n``` console\r\ncd ReadFramework\r\ncmake . \r\n```\r\n\r\nCompile READ Framework: \r\n``` console\r\nmake\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou will now have a binary (ReadFramework), which you can test (or use directly). Also the build libraries are in this directory. To install it to /usr/local/bin, use: \r\n``` console\r\nsudo make install\r\n```\r\n \r\n### authors\r\nMarkus Diem\r\nStefan Fiel\r\nFlorian Kleber\r\n\r\n### related links:\r\n[1] http://www.caa.tuwien.ac.at/cvl/\r\n[2] https://transkribus.eu/Transkribus/\r\n[3] https://github.com/TUWien/\r\n[4] http://nomacs.org","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
